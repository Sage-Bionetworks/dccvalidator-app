# Data submission validation

This repo contains a Shiny app to validate manifests and metadata for AMP-AD
studies. It uses the
[dccvalidator](https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/dccvalidator) package to
check for common data quality issues and gives realtime feedback to the data
contributor on errors that need to be fixed. The reporting UI is heavily inspired by the 
[MetaDIG project's metadata quality reports](https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/quality/s=knb.suite.1/doi%3A10.5063%2FF12V2D1V).

The app currently relies on the `custom-conditions` branch of the `dccvalidator`
package:

```
remotes::install_github("Sage-Bionetworks/dccvalidator@custom-conditions")
```
